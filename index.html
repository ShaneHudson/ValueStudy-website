      <p>
        Value Study is an iOS & MacOS app aimed at people learning to draw or paint. It
        helps with visualising where shadows and highlights appear within photo
        references or directly from your camera. One useful feature is selecting
        a value, which will highlight all areas of the image that matches the
        selected value... this is useful because at a glance you can see which
        tones are similar. That may sound simple but perception is a crucial
        skill which can be very hard, especially in complex colour references.
        The hope is that Value Study will help to ease the learning curve.

      <h2 id="intro">What is a value study?</h2>
      <p>
        Value studies are usually greyscale drawings with very little detail, a
        technique artists can use to practise both composition and lighting.
        They are particularly useful for beginners as exercises for learning to
        draw or paint, traditionally or digitally.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Notan is a common type of value study that uses just two values,
        usually black and white. Value Study lets you make notans by pressing
        the "-" button until there are just two values showing. However, it also
        allows for far more shades to help with seeing how details are formed.
      </p>

      <h2 id="why">Why use an app?</h2>
      <p>
        As with most things, it could be better to just work hard and practise
        drawing value studies without any help. However sometimes you just need
        a helping hand to progress, this is what Value Study is for. You can use
        it to help visualise values in everyday things, as a reference image
        before you start or to have something to compare your own value studies
        with after you've drawn them.

      <h2 id="privacy">Privacy statement</h2>
      <p>
        There are no adverts or trackers on the Value Study app. All
        functionality takes place directly on your device. Anonymous error
        logging is used to ensure bugs are found and fixed promptly. Naturally
        the app requires a reference photo to be useful, so it does let you
        select from your photo library and optionally you can allow access to
        your camera to directly capture the reference image. You can also,
        optionally, allow access to save the value studies you create back to
        your photo library. But these go nowhere else. Your images are not
        uploaded or accessed by anyone other than yourself.
