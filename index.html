        Value Study is a free iOS app, aimed at people learning to draw or
        paint, for visualising where shadows and highlights appear within photo
        references or directly from your camera. One useful feature is selecting
        a value, which will highlight all areas of the image that matches the
        selected value... this is useful because at a glance you can see which
        tones are similar. That may sound simple but perception is a crucial
        skill which can be very hard, especially in complex colour references.
        The hope is that Value Study will help to ease the learning curve.

      <h2 id="intro">What is a value study?</h2>
      <p>
        Value studies are usually greyscale drawings with very little detail, a
        technique artists can use to practise both composition and lighting.
        They are particularly useful for beginners as exercises for learning to
        draw or paint, traditionally or digitally.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Notan is a common type of value study that uses just two values,
        usually black and white. Value Study lets you make notans by pressing
        the "-" button until there are just two values showing. However, it also
        allows for far more shades to help with seeing how details are formed.
      </p>

      <h2 id="why">Why use an app?</h2>
      <p>
        As with most things, it could be better to just work hard and practise
        drawing value studies without any help. However sometimes you just need
        a helping hand to progress, this is what Value Study is for. You can use
        it to help visualise values in everyday things, as a reference image
        before you start or to have something to compare your own value studies
        with after you've drawn them.
      </p>

      <h2 id="privacy">Privacy statement</h2>
      <p>
        There are no adverts, trackers, analytics or any other form of privacy
        concerns with the Value Study iOS app. All functionality takes place
        directly on your device. Naturally the app requires a reference photo to
        be useful, so it does let you select from your photo library and
        optionally you can allow access to your camera to directly capture the
        reference image. You can also, optionally, allow access to save the
        value studies you create back to your photo library. But these go
        nowhere else.<br />Zero images or metadata are uploaded or accessed by
        anyone other than yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many apps use third-party tools to analyse usage to make the app better.
        Value Study does not do this. While useful, it goes against our values
        (pun intended) to send data to other companies when it's not required.
        So we use the limited analytics provided to all developers directly by
        Apple.<br />For the rest, we
