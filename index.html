      <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Statement</h2>
      <p>
        There are no adverts, trackers, analytics or any other form of privacy
        concerns with the Value Study iOS app. All functionality takes place
        directly on your device. Naturally the app requires a reference photo to
        be useful, so it does let you select from your photo library and
        optionally you can allow access to your camera to directly capture the
        reference image. You can also, optionally, allow access to save the
        value studies you create back to your photo library. But these go
        nowhere else.<br />Zero images or metadata are uploaded or accessed by
        anyone other than yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many apps use third-party tools to analyse usage to make the app better.
        Value Study does not do this. While useful, it goes against our values
        (pun intended) to send data to other companies when it's not required.
        So we use the limited analytics provided to all developers directly by
        Apple.<br />For the rest, we

        and reviews on the App Store.
